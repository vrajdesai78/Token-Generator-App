# Token-Generator-App
This is a token generator app developed using android studio (Java) and firebase.

I have developed an online appointment booking system. To implement this online appointment system I have used android studio to develop android application. I have developed two application one for End-User and another for business-users. In end-user application, user is able to register himself/herself or login via google to start booking appointment. User can see his/her appointment in your booking’s section of the application. A unique QR code will be generated for each and every booking. For business user, business user first need to register his/her business to avail online booking service. After registration, business user can manage bookings of his/her business in home page of application. A QR code scanner is implemented in Business user application to ensure authentication of booking. 

To run this application in your local machine. First you need android studio with proper android sdk.
